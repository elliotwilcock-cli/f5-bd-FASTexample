sharepoint/sharepoint
What is the tenant name?
myapps
The tenant is the high-level grouping in an AS3 declaration. FAST deploys all configuration for a given tenant in a BIG-IP partition of the same name.

What is the application name?
Sharepoint
The application is the low-level grouping in an AS3 declaration. FAST deploys all configuration for a given application in a BIG-IP folder within the tenant partition.

What is the Sharepoint application's FQDN?
sharepoint.aserracorp.com
Clients can use the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) you enter here to access the SharePoint servers. Your DNS administrator must configure a DNS entry that resolves to the IP address you entered for the BIG-IP virtual server.

What IP address do you want to use for the virtual server?
206.124.129.196
This IP address, combined with the port you specify below, becomes the BIG-IP virtual server address and port, which clients use to access the application. The system intercepts requests to this IP:Port and distributes them to the SharePoint servers.

What TCP port do you want to use for the virtual server?
443
Redirect port 80 traffic to this virtual server
Pool Members
Which SharePoint servers should be included in this pool?

row	
172.16.60.106
What TCP port do you want to use for the pool members?
80
TLS Server
Enable TLS server to decrypt client-side connections.

Specify the name of an existing BIG-IP SSL certificate.

/Common/default.crt
Specify the name of an existing BIG-IP SSL key.

/Common/default.key
TLS Client
Enable TLS client to encrypt server-side connections.

Specify the type of network that connects clients to the BIG-IP system

wan
Specify the type of network that connects servers to the BIG-IP system

lan
HTTP Compression
Create a profile based on wan-optimized-compression? If not select an existing profile below.
Connection Multiplexing
Works with HTTP Keep-Alives to allow the BIG-IP system to minimize the number of server-side TCP connections by making existing connections available for reuse by other clients.
